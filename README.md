# Vrinda-Store
In this project I have analyzed the vrinda store, (which is a fictional retail outlet) dataset in Excel. The purpose is to learn data cleaning and presenting data insights.

Vrinda is an imaginary store but with a massive database comprising of columns like Orders, Age, Age Group, Genders and more..

Some common questions we need to answer for this dataset are:
  a. Compare the sales and orders using single chart
  b. Which month got the highest sales and orders?
  c. Who purchased more: Men or Women in 2022?
  d. Relationship between age and gender based on number of orders?
